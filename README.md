OpenSit
=======

OpenSit is a place where ordinary people who engage in some form of regular meditation practice can record their experiences and connect with eachother.

We all share in the same highs and lows of the human condition, and more and more of us are choosing to spend time in contemplation as a means of attaining clarity, peace and freedom, in this life. 

As a support for contemplative practice, it can be useful to maintain a diary. Diaries are used to record the insights and effects experienced through meditation, offering a sense of deepening in one’s practice, whilst providing a strong support for maintaining regular practice (there’s no motivation like a blank page!)

OpenSit is an online meditation diary where you can record your practice, journal your insights and connect with other contemplatives. It helps to support a pragmatic and transformative approach to spiritual practice, built on the open platform of the internet.

We’re not interested in who or what you believe, but what you *practice*. What happens when you actually sit down on the cushion and shut your eyes? And how does this regular practice affect your sense of wellbeing, and the way you think about and act within the world?

Anyone who has truly immersed themselves in contemplative practice knows that strange and wonderful things can and do happen on the cushion, and it’s time to talk about this honestly. The selflessness realised in authentic meditation is too important to stay under robes.

It is my hope that the community that emerges from the activities of many individual contemplatives supporting each other will serve to facilitate the open discussion of meditation and its transformative effects, from equanimity, to energetic phenomena, to enlightenment.

How does OpenSit work?
----------------------
Users arrive at the website, either through being linked to a specific sit report, a user profile or navigating to OpenSit.com manually. From there they can easily sign up themselves.

Each user has a **profile** to hold various details about themselves and their practice, and the rest of the user’s data is stored chronologically in their **SitStream** as a series of different events:

* A *sit* is a record of a particular sit, containing information about your approach and what actually happened in that time period.
* A *diary* entry where you talk about your practice in general and particularly how you feel practice is affecting your outlook and actions in the world. Sits and diaries are delineated simply based on whether you enter a sit duration or not.
* *Markers* delineate and describe continuous periods of your practice, highlighting progress and changes in attitude or focus along the path. Think of them as milestones for yourself and others browsing your notes.
* *Articles* are more formal writings: technique recommendations, new perspectives on meditation, models of progress and understanding, and perhaps even more scholarly works on the interface between contemplation and neuroscience.

Users are free to participate in different intensities. If you want to log all your sits in detail, write diary entries and articles, you can. If you just want a basic profile and the possibility of connecting with other contemplatives, that's fine as well.

One problem in discussing contemplative experiences is the ambiguity of certain terms and phrases. To remedy this, there is also the possibility for each user to define their own *glossary* of basic terms, expounding upon their own personal interpretations and usages. These definitions could be loaded as rollovers when hovering over particular terms in a users SitStream.

Platform
--------
OpenSit is a contemplative expression platform, and a potential springboard for discussion elsewhere. It will provide a common format for contemplatives to track and share insights without having to cross reference blog posts, forum posts, emails and other scattered notes. Your profile and SitStream are available at any time, from any where, all in one place, as a record of your practice history and experiences – the nuts and bolts of what you have done and what has happened as a result.

OpenSit is not a standard discussion forum – users can make short comments on each other’s sits, diaries and articles but there is not currently an open forum to create new discussions. As a result, discussion is centred around the particulars of a specific experiment, thus avoiding a forum-based free-for-all without grounding, context, and the spirit of mutual respect. I believe this will keep debate more relevant and productive.

However, users are able to create and join groups of others sharing similar practices, goals or geographic locations, and these groups will have their own discussion areas. Again, I hope this will increase the quality of debate as it is occurring between practitioners with some common understanding, and these groups can collate information, discuss technicalities and potentially collaborate on articles.

To support the idea of OpenSit as a platform of expression, I hope to develop an OpenSit API so that users can seamlessly integrate their “contemplative profiles” and updates with other websites and forums related to the practice of meditation and awakening. For example, an applet that would allow you to easily include the 5 most recent events in your SitStream on your personal website.

Teaching
--------
OpenSit also offers new potentials as a teaching platform. Interactive and syndicated SitStreams would make student-mentor co-ordination much easier, with all the details necessary to keep track of and guide a students’ progress in one searchable, organised location. All new content could easily be tracked through RSS feeds.

There is also the opportunity to test more automated approaches to assisting newcomers to meditation. A user could enable a smart script known as a trainer (i.e. Vipassana 101, Shinzen's Five Ways, Zen Stick) which would “interact” with them over time to provide basic instructions, tips, and topics to reflect upon.

Trainers are not a replacement for human teachers, but they are a potentially useful interactive tool. Trainers can be programmed to give certain information at certain times, but with development and user input they could become more intelligent and responsive - an interactive script that would narrow down your sticking issues - Can you sit comfortably? Do you understand what is meant by the term impermanence? Can you see that sensations arise and pass? Are you seeing this consistently? Is there some area where you struggle to see this? - and then provide relevant information. Over time people could develop their own trainers with tradition specific instructions. There is the potential for users who have stuck it out with a trainer to locate others who have gone through the same process, and share experiences in a group. (Shinzen Young has already experimented with interactive telephone versions of similar scripts.)

OpenSit as a teaching platform could also expand to group-based teaching, supported through video, live discussion, text and other media.

Research
--------
The publicly shared insights of thousands of practitioners will also create an unprecedented commonwealth of first person reporting. Users that are happy to share this information could create a pool of data that may be very useful to neuroscientists and investigators.

All this is based on the assumption that the cross fertilisation of contemplative insight and scientific knowledge will greatly benefit both, contributing to what we might call a science of enlightenment and potentially paradigm-busting discoveries such as the identification of external markers of significant internal change along the axis of selflessness.

As the community develops and the dialogue between scientists and contemplatives continues to flower, OpenSit may be able to contribute important data for those working at the intersection of neuroscience and meditation.

As one example:
* A group of investigators wish to investigate the effects of a certain type of meditation, being practised for a certain amount of time per day.
* They post a request for volunteers, describing the meditation and what else might be required.
* People choose to sign up. They carry out the experiments, and then submit the resulting first person accounts into custom designed forms.
* The investigators now have a rich pool of data that could be strengthened with brain scans or other means of measurement.

Requirements Definition
-----------------------
### Goal/Scope
* To establish a free platform whereby people can record and share meditation practice, to inspire people to practice, and to further the global understanding and impact of meditation.

### Core functionality
* Provide users with an intuitive and accessible means of logging their meditation practice, insights and results - an online diary.
* Make it easy for users to view, share, syndicate and download their recorded practice.

Future!
-------
* iPhone/android app
* Geo-location functionality so people can search for practitioners near them and arrange meet ups.
* The best interface is no interface - voice dictate your sits! Plug in to biofeedback machines and automatically record that. Auto-location, auto-mood...! 
* Sit together (real time).
* User reputation/upvote system - upvotes for helping others out & writing quality content? Unsure about this.
* Shared terminology / vocabulary? Maintained through wiki contribution. (mindtrainingterms.com) People can help contribute to and refine first person terminology through their reports. Each entry can contain links to first person reports of the term (i.e. unknowing event, dark night, chakra energetics)
* Standalone application - export to XML and load your SitStream into other software packages. Also load other peoples for offline browsing etc.
