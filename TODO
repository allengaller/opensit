FEATURES
- Tags: add ‘A&P’ tag to your sit, or 'vipassana' or 'retreat'. view all sits you’ve also tagged ‘A&P’, and potentially search the entire site for practitioners who have tagged a certain sit ‘A&P’. also 
- Individual glossary, with rollovers on defined terms.
- Ability to quick link to previous sits/articles in a new sit/article. Just my sits or others as well?

FUTURE
- iPhone/android app
- Adding geo-location stuff so people can search for practitioners near them and arrange meet ups.
- The best interface is no interface - voice dictate your sits! plug in to biofeedback machines and automatically record that. Auto-location, auto-mood...! sit together and auto transcribe any dialog into sit report.
- Duration and style as types of tag, with ability for users to define other types of tags. Really gives users the ability to create what they want but more development work.
- User reputation /upvote system - upvotes for helping others out & writing quality content?
- Sit together - sit "with" someone online. Share thoughts, communicate via audio/visual. Perfect for teaching
- OpenSit could provide statistics and feedback on your practice - qualitative content analysis of written reports, and quantitative assessments regarding sitting trends (e.g. always getting drunk and missing weekend sits).
- Shared terminology / vocabulary? Maintained through wiki contribution. (mindtrainingterms.com) People can help contribute to and refine first person terminology through their reports. linking to 1st person reports of each term (i.e. unknowing event)
- Standalone application - export to XML and load your SitStream into other software packages. Also load other peoples for offline browsing etc.
- Link to any sutta with Access To Insight plugin?

Group forums

Group types: Hidden (only members can see it), Closed (everyone can see it, but users must manually be added), Open (anyone can join), and Request (users can request to be added by the Group Leader).

Read/unread for each user & thread - you can keep a separate database table to keep a record for every topic X every user if the user has read it (no record if the user hasn't), and then automatically assume after 30 days that the topic is read, which allows you to prune this table to prevent overgrowth. Keeping a separate table like this is pretty standard practice, and unless this forum is super popular (always plan for popularity I guess), I doubt you'll run into space or CPU limits.

For example, table topics_read has fields user_id, topic_id, and when. Storing two ints and a date is only a few bytes for each row.

Thread vs response/post
Same type, top level thread just has parent_id of null

Multiple forums?
i.e. different forums within each group page (i.e. Meetups, Introductions, Technical)
Simple StackOverflow interface.
